## Management  System
본 프로젝트는 React Node.js 공부용 고객관리 시스템 (Management System)입니다.

1. Git commit , push 
2. Function Component , props 상속 
3. Component 구조화 , map 함수를 이용한 Component 간략화 
4. Apply Material UI 
5. client , server 폴더 분리 / Node.js Express server 구축 
6. \
6.1 REST API 구축 \
6.2 Proxy 설정 \
6.3 async await을 이용하여 json형태로 api 호출 \
6.4 useEffect, useState를 이용한 react hook 썻지만 정확한 이해 필요 \
6.5 문제 1 : map을 이용하지 않고 하나만 데이터 바인딩시 오류 ? 어떻게 해야하나 다 듣고 다시 고민해 볼 것 날짜 : 2022.12.07 
7. 라이프 사이클 API에 로딩 처리 몇번 더 해봐야 이해가 가능할듯싶다


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
